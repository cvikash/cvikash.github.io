      <h2>Research Focus</h2>
      <p>
        I am a final year PhD student at the <strong>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics</strong> 
        in Tübingen, Germany. Under the co-supervision of <strong>Dr. Jennifer Li</strong> and 
        <strong>Dr. Drew Robson</strong>, my research delves into unraveling the neural mechanisms 
        underlying internal states.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, I investigate the neural substrates responsible for maintaining and triggering 
        substates of zebrafish quiescence. This work combines advanced imaging techniques, behavioral 
        analysis, and computational modeling to understand how the brain orchestrates state transitions 
        and maintains internal stability.

      <h2>Current Work</h2>
      <p>
        My current research focuses on understanding the complex neural dynamics that govern behavioral 
        states in zebrafish. Through advanced imaging techniques including two-photon calcium imaging 
        and optogenetics, combined with computational modeling and machine learning approaches, I aim to 
        uncover the fundamental principles that regulate internal state transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work has implications for understanding how the brain maintains homeostasis, how states 
        are encoded in neural circuits, and how disruptions in state regulation might contribute to 
        various neurological conditions.
